<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>
This responsive To Do List Web App was developed with Vite + React.js.
You can add and remove tasks, mark and unmark as completed, and you can also filter between completed and incomplete tasks. 
One of the most interesting features is that data is saved in local storage memory, so that tasks are not lost when closing or reloading the page.
